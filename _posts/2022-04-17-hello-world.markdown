It's been a while since I blogged, didn't want to go for wordpress blog again so I decided to try out this github sites thing (back then I was studying biotech).

I'll recently switched to OpenSuse Tumbleweed (coming from Manjaro/Garuda) and although it took me a few days to start getting comfortable, I now have my setup a bit better than with arch.
I wouldn't say OpenSuse is as hard as Arch but it certainly has a learning curve (IMO just a little steeper than Fedora).  
Even though this distro is amazing, I was a bit surprised to find not as many guides/how tos as with other distros. I wasn't expecting Ubuntu/Arch levels of hype, but at least Fedora like, so I decided to help with this lack of hype situation even if it was just through a few notes on how I got my setup going, maybe they can be of help to someone.
